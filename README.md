# Node.js Starter Application

Bluemix provides a Node.js starter application as a template so that you can
add your code and push the changes back to the Bluemix environment.

## Files

The Node.js starter application has files as below:

* app.js

	This file contains the server side JavaScript code for your application
	written using the express server package.

* public/

	This directory contains public resources of the application, that will be
	served up by this server

* package.json

	This file contains metadata about your application, that is used by both
	the `npm` program to install packages, but also Bluemix when it's
	staging your application.  For more information, see:
	<https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json>
=======
This README.md file is displayed on your project page. You should edit this 
file to describe your project, including instructions for building and 
running the project, pointers to the license under which you are making the 
project available, and anything else you think would be useful for others to
know.

We have created an empty license.txt file for you. Well, actually, it says,
"<Replace this text with the license you've chosen for your project.>" We 
recommend you edit this and include text for license terms under which you're
making your code available. A good resource for open source licenses is the 
[Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/).

Be sure to update your project's profile with a short description and 
eye-catching graphic.

Finally, consider defining some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give 
interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.
